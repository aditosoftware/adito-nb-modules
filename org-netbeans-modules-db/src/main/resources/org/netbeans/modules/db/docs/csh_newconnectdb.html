        <h2>New Connection Wizard: Customize Connection Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to supply the details to create a new database connection.

        You open this dialog box by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the Databases node in the Services window and choose New Connection. Specify the driver and click Next. </li>
            <li>Right-click a driver node under the Databases node in the Services window and choose Connect Using.</li>
            <li>Clicking Add Connection in the Resolve Data Sources dialog box.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>In this dialog box, you supply the details needed to connect to a specific database.
        Depending on the database driver you are using, you need to supply some or all of the following database connection properties. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Driver Name.</b> Confirm that the JDBC driver you want to use is the correct one for your database. This drop-down list only contains drivers registered with the IDE. 
            If your driver is not listed, you need to <a href="adddriver.html">add the JDBC driver</a> at the previous step of the New Connection wizard.</li>
          <li><strong>Host.</strong> Type the hostname for the database. Use <tt>localhost</tt> if the database is located on a local machine.</li>
          <li><strong>Port.</strong> Type the post to be used by the database connection. Refer to the database documentation to know the default port number for your database.</li>
          <li><strong>Database</strong> or <strong>Service ID</strong>. Type the name of the database instance.</li>
          <li><b>User Name.</b> Type user name for the database.</li>
          <li><b>Password.</b> Type the password for the database.</li>
          <li><b>Remember Password.</b> Select this if you want the IDE to remember your password.
            If selected, you will not be prompted for the user name and password on subsequent connections to the database
            and the Remember Password property is set to True.
            <br>
            To set the Remember Password property to False, right-click the database connection node
            in the Services window and choose Properties and modify the property in the Properties window (only when the connection is in the disconnected state).          </li>
          <li><b>JDBC URL. </b> View the JDBC URL for this connection. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the database to which you want to connect contains database schemas, you can click Next
        and select a schema in the Choose Database Schemas panel.</p>
