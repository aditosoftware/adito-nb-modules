        <h2>Adding a JDBC Driver: New Connection Wizard and Add Driver</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>To connect to a database from within the IDE, you must specify an appropriate JDBC driver for this database. You can do this in two ways: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Right-click the Databases node in the Services window and choose New Connection. The Locate Driver dialog box opens. </li>
          <li>Right-click a driver node under the Databases node in the Services window and choose Add Driver. The New JDBC Driver dialog box opens. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Supply the following details in the dialog box to add the JDBC driver. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Driver.</strong> Choose the driver for the database you want to add.</li>
          <li><strong>Driver File(s).</strong> Click Add and locate the archive file of the driver you want to add.</li>
          <li><strong>Driver Class</strong> (in the New JDBC Driver dialog box).
              After you choose a valid archive file, the Driver Class and
          the Name fields should be filled in by the IDE. <br>
          Click Find if the Driver Class field is empty or incorrect.
            <p>
            The IDE will search the archive files that you selected in the 
            previous step and find all classes that implement the JDBC
            API Driver interface (<tt>java.sql.Driver</tt>). The Driver 
            Class combo box lists the classes that the IDE finds. Use the 
          combo box to select the driver class that you need.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note">
		   <li>Adding a new driver only creates a template for
            new connections. The IDE does not actually try to use that driver or check 
            it to ensure it is correct until a connection is made. </li>
           <li>You can add the driver directly at the <a href="connectdb.html">first step when setting up a connection</a> and skip the New Driver dialog box. </li>
    </ul>
