    for various user-interface types and optional module information.

    of DTD for the document. Attribute is used to perform simple versioning
    without the need to use time-consuming xml validation using this DTD.

<!ATTLIST tc-group
    version CDATA #REQUIRED

<!-- Optional element for module information. Attribute name specifies name of
    module which defines this xml description. Module information is used for
    automatic removal of top component reference defined by module if module
    is disabled.
    If you want your module's top component reference to be removed
    automatically when your module is disabled, fill this element.
    When this element is missing, no automatic removal will be done.
 1) "name" code name of the module, can be either base code name or full code
    name with slash and release number. Examples for core module are:
