-//NetBeans//DTD Mode Properties 1.2//EN
-->

<!-- The root element for mode properties. Consists of name, optional
     module information and several property sets for various types of
     user interface.
     Atribute "version" is optional versioning attribute, which in fact specifies
     version of this DTD. Attribute is used to perform simple versioning
     without the need to use time-consuming xml validation using this DTD.
-->

<!ATTLIST mode
    version CDATA #IMPLIED

<!-- User interface type element, holds mode property set for specific type
    of user interface. UI type is identified by its only attribute "type",
    Value "any" is special value which is reserved for default setting set which
    is used when property set for specific ui-type is not found. Thus, simplest variant is to
    define only one property set with type "any", which means that for all
    types of user interface mode will have same properties. -->

<!-- Optional element for module information. Attribute name specifies name of
    module which defines this xml description. Module information is used for
    automatic removal of mode defined by module if module is unistalled.
    If you want your module's mode to be unistalled automatically when
    your module is deinstalled, fill this element. When this element is missing,
    no automatic removal will be done.
 1) "name" code name of the module, can be either base code name or full code
    name with slash and release number. Examples for core module are: 
    "org.netbeans.core" or "org.netbeans.core/1"
 2) "spec" is specification version of the module which defines this xml description.
-->

<!-- Element name has four attributes
    1) "unique" represents UID of mode unique in context of surrounding workspace
    2) "display" represents optional display name of the mode.
       If display name is not specified, unique name is used as display name
       too. If "from-bundle" flag is enabled, this attribute must contain
       bundle key where to find localized display name. (example value: "CTL_MyModeName")
    3) "from-bundle" flag to control if display name is taken from bundle or not
    4) "bundle" identifies bundle from which localized display name will be read.
       Format is the same like for fully qualified classes. For example, 
       localization bundle named "Bundle" in package "my.package" can be pointed
       to by value "my.package.Bundle".
       Attributes "bundle" and "display" together give fully qualified bundle
       pointer. This attribute is optional, has no meaning if "from-bundle" is false

    1) "display" represents bundle key where to find localized 
        mode description. (example value: "CTL_MyModeDescription")
    2) "bundle" identifies bundle from which localized description will be read.
       Format is the same like for fully qualified classes. For example, 
       localization bundle named "Bundle" in package "my.package" can be pointed
       to by value "my.package.Bundle".
